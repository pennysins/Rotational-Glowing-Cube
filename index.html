    <p> We came up with this idea because as an I.T, technology is our identity. 
        <br> We gain attention through the use of technology. Just like the cube's<br>
        relentless motion, an I.T is always in motion, constantly adapting to the <br>
        ever-evolving technological landscape. The cube represents the drive for progress, <br>
        pushing the boundaries of innovation and knowledge. Its movements symbolize the <br>
        constant pursuit of improvement and commitment to staying at the forefront of <br>
        information technology. The cube's structure, with its clean lines and geometric <br>
        precision, mirrors the logical and analytical thinking cultivated in an IT school. <br>
        It represents the systematic approach and problem-solving skills that we acquire <br>
        during our studies. The cube's sleek design also reflects the emphasis on aesthetics <br>
        and user experience in the field of IT, highlighting the importance of combining <br>
        functionality with visual appeal. A cube has three dimensions (length, width, and height), <br>
        while an IT student explores various dimensions within the field of information technology, <br>
        such as programming, networking, databases, cyber security, and more.</p> 
        
        <br>

        <p class="last">That's how we came up with this moving cube animation.</p>
